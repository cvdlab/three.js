# Three.js for Bower

Official [three.js repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#threejs) is too large on Bower, so I picked files out from that repo.

Current version: [r72](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r71).

In this repo the version is converted to `0.72.0` in semantic version for Bower to recognize.

### Usage

In your `bower.json`:

```
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "three.js": "cvdlab/three.js"
  ...
}
```
